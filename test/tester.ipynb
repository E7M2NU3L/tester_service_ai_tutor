The primary function of proteins is not to store genetic information.\\n*   **Score:** 0/1\\n*   **Feedback:** Proteins have diverse functions, including acting as enzymes, structural components, and signaling molecules. Genetic information is stored in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).\\n\\n**Question 4:**\\n*   **Answer:** Biopolymers and synthetic polymers have no significant differences; both are man-made materials.\\n*   **Correctness:** Incorrect. Biopolymers are naturally occurring, while synthetic polymers are man-made.\\n*   **Score:** 0/1\\n*   **Feedback:** Biopolymers are produced by living organisms, while synthetic polymers are synthesized by humans.\\n\\n**Question 5:**\\n*   **Answer:** The monomer unit of cellulose is amino acid.\\n*   **Correctness:** Incorrect. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not cellulose.\\n*   **Score:** 0/1\\n*   **Feedback:** The monomer unit of cellulose is glucose, a type of sugar.'}\n"
